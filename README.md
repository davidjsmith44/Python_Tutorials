# Introductory Python Tutorials 
This is a series of introductory python tutorials I am building for Kate.

They will be start as Jupyter Notebooks and later we will move to either VSCode or some other IDE

Topics will include
 - Lists
 - Strings
 - Dictionary
 - Tuples
 - arrays
 
 First we will work with strings and create simple programs
 
 Then we will discuss what to put in a dictionary (starting with tri-angles)
 
 Then we will use tuples as a coordinate system (x, y)
 
 Then we will start by building out the unit circle
 
 Then we will tackle physics problems
